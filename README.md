# StaticArtWithShapes

## Instructions:
Create an art app similar to the Painter app in Section 13.3 that allows you to draw shapes by clicking and dragging the mouse in a Pane and adding an appropriate Shape object to the scene graph. Include options for:

selecting the Shape subclass to drawâ€”Line, Rectangle, Circle, or Ellipse.
changing the stroke color and thickness.
specifying the fill color for Rectangles, Circles, or Ellipses.
Provide red, green, and blue sliders that allow you to select the RGBA color for the line or fill. Include a color swatch below the three sliders so that as you move each slider, the color swatch shows you the current drawing color. Also include options that allow you to undo the last shape and to clear the entire drawing. Enable the user to select an existing shape and move it or delete it.
